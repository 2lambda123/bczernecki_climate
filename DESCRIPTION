Description: Automatize downloading of meteorological and hydrological data from publicly available repositories:
    OGIMET (<http://ogimet.com/index.phtml.en>), 
    University of Wyoming - atmospheric vertical profiling data (<http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair>),
    and Polish Institute of Meterology and Water Management - National Research Institute (<https://dane.imgw.pl>).
    This package also allows for adding geographical coordinates for each observation.
