The goal of the  **climate** R package is to automatize downloading of meteorological
and hydrological data from publicly available repositories:

- OGIMET [(ogimet.com)](http://ogimet.com/index.phtml.en) 
- University of Wyoming - atmospheric vertical profiling data (http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/).
- Polish Institute of Meterology and Water Management - National Research Institute [(IMGW-PIB)](https://dane.imgw.pl/)

## Functions 

The **climate** package consists of four main functions - two for meteorological data, one for hydrological data and one for sounding data:

1. Meteorological data:

- **meteo_ogimet()** - Downloading hourly and daily meteorological data from the SYNOP stations available in the ogimet.com collection.
Meteorological (aka Synop) station working under the World Meteorological Organizaton framework after year 2000 should be accessible.
- **meteo_imgw()** -  Downloading hourly, daily, and monthly meteorological data from the SYNOP/CLIMATE/PRECIP stations available in the danepubliczne.imgw.pl collection. 
It is a wrapper for `meteo_monthly()`, `meteo_daily()`,
and `meteo_hourly()` from **imgw** package.

2. Hydrological data: 

- **hydro_imgw()** -  Downloading with daily, monthly, annual interval hydrological data from the stations available in the danepubliczne.imgw.pl collection. 
It is a wrapper for `hydro_annual()`, `hydro_monthly()`, and `hydro_daily()`    from **imgw** package.

3. Rawinsonde data: 

- **sounding_wyoming()** - Downloading measurements of the vertical profile of atmosphere (aka rawinsonde data)
    
## Application

We will show how to use our package and prepare the data for spatial analysis with the additional help of the [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) and [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) packages.
Firstly, we download ten years (**2001-2010**) of monthly hydrological observations for all stations available and automatically add their spatial coordinates. 

```{r data}
h = hydro_imgw(interval = "monthly", year = 2001:2010, coords = TRUE)
head(h)
```

The `idex` variable represents id of the extremum, where `1` means minimum, `2` mean, and `3` maximum.^[You can find more information about this in the `imgw_hydro_abbrev` dataset.]
Hydrologists often use the maximum value so we will filter the data and select only the station `id`, hydrological year (`hyy`), latitude `X` and longitude `Y`.
Next, we will calculate the mean maximum value of the flow on the stations in each year with **dplyr**'s `summarise()`, and spread data by year using **tidyr**'s `spread()` to get the annual means of maximum flow in the consecutive columns.

```{r filtering, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
h2 = h %>%
  filter(idex == 3) %>%
  select(id, station, X, Y, hyy, Q) %>%
  group_by(hyy, id, station, X, Y) %>%
  summarise(annual_mean_Q = round(mean(Q, na.rm = TRUE), 1)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = hyy, values_from = annual_mean_Q)
```

```{r filtering2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(h2), caption = "Examplary data frame of hydrological preprocesssing.")
```

<!-- The resulting table can be easily exported to any spatial software with a changing annual maximum annual average water flow rate over the decade for Poland as a whole. -->
The result represents changes in the annual maximum average of water flow rate over the decade for all available stations in Poland. 
We can save it to:

- `.csv` with: `write.csv(result, file = "result.csv", sep = ";",dec = ".", col.names = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)`. 
This command saves our result to `result.csv` where the column's separator is `;`, the decimal is `.`, we are keeping the headers of columns and remove names of rows.

- `.xlsx` with: `write.xlsx(result, file = "result.xlsx", sheetName = "Poland", append = FALSE)`
This command saves our result to result.xlsx with the name of the sheet `Poland`. Argument `append = TRUE` adds the sheet to already existing `xlsx` file.
To save data in `.xlsx` you have first to install the **writexl** package with command: `install.packages("writexl")`, and add it: `library(writexl)`.
 
The annual means of maximum flow can be also presented on the map using the **tmap** package:

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
world = ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

h3 = h2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(X)) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("X", "Y"))

tm_shape(h3) + 
  tm_symbols(size = as.character(c(2001:2010)),
             title.size = "The annual means of maximum flow") +
  tm_facets(free.scales = FALSE, ncol = 4) + 
  tm_shape(world) + 
  tm_borders(col = "black", lwd = 2) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c(-1.25, 0.05),
            outer.margins = c(0, 0.05, 0, -0.25),
            panel.labels = as.character(c(2001:2010)))
```
